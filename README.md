# The Light Between Shadows - Godot Game

A single-player narrative exploration game based on the dark fantasy novel, where you play as Eilidh uncovering the truth about humanity's lost heritage on Proxima Centauri B.

## 🌟 Game Overview

**Genre:** Narrative Adventure / Mystery / Exploration  
**Platform:** PC/Mac/Linux (Godot Engine)  
**Player Count:** Single Player  
**Estimated Playtime:** 8-12 hours  

### Core Concept
Experience the story of Eilidh, a pattern-seeker investigating the mysterious decline of her people's abilities in the twilight settlement of Scáthghlenn. Uncover genealogy records, explore hidden archives, and discover humanity's true origins among the stars - all while being the only character in a world that feels both alive and hauntingly empty.

## 🎮 Key Features

- **Solo Journey:** Play as Eilidh in a deeply personal narrative with no other characters to interact with
- **Environmental Storytelling:** Discover the story through documents, artifacts, and environmental clues
- **Pattern Recognition Gameplay:** Use Eilidh's analytical mind to solve genealogy puzzles and uncover connections
- **Atmospheric Exploration:** Navigate the twilight world of Proxima Centauri B with its unique 11-day cycles
- **Nanite Abilities:** Experience the "magic" system as dormant technology awakening
- **Multiple Endings:** Your choices determine how much truth Eilidh reveals and preserves

## 🌍 Setting

**Proxima Centauri B** - A tidally locked world orbiting a red dwarf star, where humanity's lost colony has regressed to medieval society. The game takes place in Scáthghlenn, the last settlement where the old bloodlines and their mysterious abilities remain strong.
